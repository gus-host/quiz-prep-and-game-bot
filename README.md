# My Idea
My idea for the hackathon involves basically two projects.
- A discord quiz prep and game bot
- An article - A guide on how to use Powershell terminal to attempt quests.

## First Idea: A discord quiz prep and game bot
As the name implies the discord bot is a quiz prep and game bot. 
- The idea behind the quiz prep is basically to help stackies attempt or increase their chances of winning quizzes on the [quiz time](https://discord.com/channels/895564164783808523/1084499262144000021) channel on stackup discord server.
- Stackies would have to go to the server I created on any of the channels to test themselves on some likely possible questions which I have created in my code.
- For instance if a quiz would be on the [Towards Wallet Solutions in Web3](https://earn.stackup.dev/campaigns/towards-wallet-solutions-in-web3) campaign, and specifically on the first quest [Overview of wallets](https://earn.stackup.dev/campaigns/towards-wallet-solutions-in-web3/quests/quest-1-overview-of-wallets-1a83) stackies could come to the quiz discord bot on my server to test themselves for that quest and get prepared for the quiz on [quiz time](https://discord.com/channels/895564164783808523/1084499262144000021).

This is a video demo of the functionality of the game.
