# My Idea
My idea for the hackathon involves basically two projects.
- A discord quiz prep and game bot
- An article - A guide on how to use Powershell terminal to attempt quests.

## First Idea: A discord quiz prep and game bot.
As the name implies the discord bot is a quiz prep and game bot. 
### quiz prep
- The idea behind the quiz prep is basically to help stackies attempt or increase their chances of winning quizzes on the [quiz time](https://discord.com/channels/895564164783808523/1084499262144000021) channel on stackup discord server.
- Stackies would have to go to the server I created on any of the channels to test themselves on some likely possible questions which I have created in my code.
- For instance if a quiz would be on the [Towards Wallet Solutions in Web3](https://earn.stackup.dev/campaigns/towards-wallet-solutions-in-web3) campaign, and specifically on the first quest [Overview of wallets](https://earn.stackup.dev/campaigns/towards-wallet-solutions-in-web3/quests/quest-1-overview-of-wallets-1a83) stackies could come to the quiz discord bot on my server to test themselves for that quest and get prepared for the quiz on [quiz time](https://discord.com/channels/895564164783808523/1084499262144000021).

This is a video demo of the functionality of the quiz prep.

### Game - Guess my number Game
This is a very simple game added as one of the features of the discord bot. The focus here is to help stackies to increase engagement with the bot.
#### How to Play the Quiz with Emoji Reactions
-Start the quiz: A user can start a quiz by typing !startquiz in the Discord chat. The bot will ask the first question. The user has 1 minute to answer each question by reacting with the corresponding emoji.

-Answer a question: Users can react with the correct emoji to answer the question (e.g., 1️⃣, 2️⃣, 3️⃣, 4️⃣). The bot will respond with whether the answer is correct and proceed to the next question.

-Timer: If the user does not answer within 1 minute, the bot will inform the user that their time is up and move to the next question.

-End of the quiz: When all questions have been answered or time is up, the bot will display the user's score and end the quiz. You can also end it by using !endquiz

-Restarting the quiz: If users want to play again, they can simply use the !startquiz command to begin a new round.
