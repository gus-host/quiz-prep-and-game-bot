# My Idea
My idea for the hackathon involves basically two projects.
- A discord quiz prep and game bot
- An article - A guide on how to use Powershell terminal to attempt quests.

## First Idea: A discord quiz prep and game bot
As the name implies the discord bot is a quiz prep and game bot. The idea behind the quiz prep is basically to help stackies attempt or increase their chances of winning quizzes on the [quiz time](https://discord.com/channels/895564164783808523/1084499262144000021)
